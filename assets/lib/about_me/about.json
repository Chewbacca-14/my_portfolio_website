  "about": "My name is Max Bulanovich, and I’m a Flutter developer. My journey into programming didn’t start in a typical way.\n\nAt first, I wasn’t interested in coding at all — I had no idea how apps were built and didn’t even try to learn. But I’ve always been curious about how things work: how a camera captures an image, why a car moves, how sound comes through headphones.\n\nEverything changed on September 14, 2022, when I randomly came across a TikTok video: a timelapse of someone building an app with Flutter, and the result instantly appeared on the phone emulator. That moment struck me. I didn’t understand what I was seeing, but I was fascinated by how code could turn ideas into a visual result right away.\n\nI dove into the comments, where people mentioned words like framework, cross-platform, Dart, Flutter… all of it was new to me. I started googling, and the very same day I found a YouTube tutorial where someone built a simple ToDo app with Flutter and Firebase. I didn’t just watch it — I immediately started coding along.\n\nThat day I spent around 10 hours learning, and by the end, I was already building my first app. That app became Budget Manager, which I worked on from October to December 2022 and eventually published on Google Play.\n\nFrom the start, I had countless questions and spent hours every day learning. It wasn’t a burden — it was incredibly exciting. I’ve always loved exploring new technologies and experimenting with fresh ideas, and Flutter opened a whole new world for me.\n\nIn May 2023, I received my first freelance offer. Together with a colleague, we built a real-world app. That was the moment I realized: I’m creating something people will actually use. It motivated me even more. Since then, not a single day has passed without me working on a project — whether it’s a startup, a freelance app, or one of my own ideas.\n\nBut I don’t take every project. For me, it’s important to create apps that are useful, meaningful, and built with passion. That’s why I don’t work on clones, gambling apps, phishing projects, or anything harmful.\n\nIf you have an idea that can make people’s lives easier, better, or more inspiring, let’s talk! I’d love to discuss your project and see how we can bring it to life."
